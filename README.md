Raw trajectory files used for the 
isotropic tutorial of [nmrformd](https://nmrformd.readthedocs.io).
The GROMACS input files and topology are also given.

The system is made of a bulk mixture of 320 $\text{TIP4P}-\epsilon$ water molecules
and 32 $\text{PEG}300$ polymer molecules. The trajectory was recorded
during a $10\,\text{ns}$ production run performed with the open source code LAMMPS
in the NPT ensemble using a timestep of $1\,\text{fs}$.
The imposed was temperature $T = 300\,^\circ\text{K}$, and the pressure
$p = 1\,\text{atm}$. The positions of the atoms were recorded in
the *prod.xtc* file every $1\,\text{ps}$.
